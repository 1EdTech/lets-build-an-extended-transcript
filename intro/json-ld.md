### <a id="jsonld"></a> About JSON-LD

Before we start, you may have heard that the Extended Transcript standard uses [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/). (It does!)

You may also have heard things about JSON-LD that make it sound technically or conceptually difficult, but no need to worry: except where indicated in this tutorial, you don't need to do anything special to support it.

> *Technical aside*: JSON-LD is JSON. If you follow the instructions below, working with the Extended Transcript data model will be similar to working with any other JSON format.

This is great news, because if you or your stakeholders care about linked data in the future, you'll be able to leverage its JSON-LD capabilities!
