I hope this tutorial has provided a useful introduction to the Extended Transcript data model. At first blush, it may seem complicated (yes, our example is around 140 lines!), but it is conceptually quite simple.

In summary, in order to create an extended transcript, you must specify:
* the issuer (the educational institution) and person (the learner)
* transcript entities to describe the potential educational activities
* records to describe the learner's experience and/or results with the transcript entities

As we saw earlier in the tutorial, there need not be a record for every entity, and it is also possible to create records for incomplete experiences.

We didn't cover many details, including extensibility, verification, Open Badge capabilities, and alignment with other standards. For a deeper dive, take a look at the [IMS Extended Transcript](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/extended-transcript) page, the sample transcripts in the IMS Transcript Viewer, and the Recommended Practices and Implementation Guide.
