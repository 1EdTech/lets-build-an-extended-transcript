# Let's build an extended transcript!

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

If you attended a postsecondary institution, you probably know what a transcript is: a document (usually physical) with a list of courses, associated credits and grades, along with a cumulative GPA and cumulative credit hours.

While a transcript is useful for verifying a learner's educational background, it doesn't say much about the learner's journey. What material was covered in a given course? What assessments were used? What was the course's relationship to a program or degree? What skills did a learner demonstrate, and in what areas is the learner strong or still growing?
