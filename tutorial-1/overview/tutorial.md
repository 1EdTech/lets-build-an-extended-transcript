We're going to learn about the transcript data model by building a transcript from scratch.

While you do so, I encourage you to review your transcript by uploading it to the [IMS Extended Transcript Viewer](http://projects.imsglobal.org/eT-viewer/). Before we get started, take a few minutes to look at the existing sample transcripts.

Note that the Extended Transcript standard does not prescribe what a transcript looks like, or how a transcript viewer should behave. <a href="http://learningobjects.com/#/">Learning Objects</a> created this viewer for the IMS community to encourage adoption (and since then, other member institutions have contributed to the project), but other transcript viewers may look very different, perhaps omitting some types of data or displaying relationships differently.
