### <a id="what-is-et"></a> What's an extended transcript?

The [IMS Extended Transcript](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/extended-transcript) standard defines a data model and service for institutions to provide supplemental information to traditional transcripts, offering institutions the ability to recognize achievements beyond course and degree completion.

An extended transcript can include information about courses and degree programs, as well as assessments, certificates, and extracurriculars. Additionally, it provides a catch-all achievement type, and the data model is extensible.

Additionally, the standard supports competency-based education (CBE). The data model includes competencies, each of which may have complex relationships with other competencies. A transcript can represent anything from a flat list of skills to a complex ontology of competencies with alignments to other competency standards, and the institution can express a range of proficiency levels and outcomes.

The Extended Transcript standard supports interoperability with other IMS standards, such as Learner Information Systems (LIS) and the new Competencies & Academic Standards Exchange (CASE). An extended transcript can contain references to hosted badge assertions from the Open Badges standard. (Furthermore, the transcript itself can appear within a badge assertion in order to make the entire transcript verifiable.)

Due to its rich data model and interoperability with other standards, the Extended Transcript standard opens up many interesting integration possibilities. Transcript clients can fetch transcripts in order to show learners, employers, and advisors different views of learner progress and achievements. It can also be used by the learner to share a collection badges with a badge displayer, or it can be used by employers and educational partners to match learners with professional opportunities. One day, it could even be used by institutions to automatically recognize prior educational achievements.
