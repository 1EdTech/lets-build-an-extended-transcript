## <a id="first-transcript"></a> Your first transcript!

To get started, all you need is a text editor.

If you use a Mac, you can use TextEdit (under "Format" menu, select "Make Plain Text"), and if you use MS Windows, you can use Notepad. I'm using [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/), and there are plenty of other cross-platform, open source options out there.

Knowledge of [JSON](https://www.json.org/) will be helpful, but you should able to follow along regardless. If you get stuck, take a look at the [complete transcript](#complete-transcript) in the appendix.

I've added technical asides for experienced developers, but they are not essential to the tutorial, so do not be concerned if they do not make sense to you.

(*Hint*: while JSON is very forgiving about spaces, the standard is unforgiving about the presence and absence of commas. Look at examples carefully, and check for missing or superfluous commas.)
